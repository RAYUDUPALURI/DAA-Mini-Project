# DAA Mini Project 


# Mini Project -1 (Number Guessing Game)
 # (Language PYTHON)
• Build a number Guessing Game in which the user selects a range.
• Assume the user selected a range from X to Y where both X and Y are integers.
• So a random number in that range is selected by the system where the user needs to guess 
the number in minimum number of guesses.
Note: There Should be a google doc with proper algorithm, pseudo code, analysis of the problem
statement, code, all should be uploaded into Git Repository.
